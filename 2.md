This only talks about things that affect sensitivity. Ergonomics like grip to use will not be discussed here.

## Aiming with Mouse

### Operating System

![description](https://puu.sh/nJtmY/e2a5589f67.png)

In Windows, the setting shown in the image is `6/11` on the Windows "Pointer Speed" slider with "Enhance pointer precision" (Mouse acceleration) disabled. Commonly referred to as the default or `1:1` setting for mouse sensitivity. There should be a setting similar to these in other operating systems.

`6/11` is the midpoint of the 11-notch scale.

At this setting, the pointer speed is not scaled (multiplied by 1.0), so one unit of physical mouse movement corresponds to one unit of pointer movement.

This is often called the "1:1 ratio" or "true DPI" setting because it reflects the actual DPI (dots per inch) of your mouse.

Another slider can be found in Windows 10 and above is `1/20`.

<details>
<summary>Windows 10</summary>

Method 1:
**Windows Settings -> Devices -> Mouse -> Cursor Speed**  
This just maps to the same 11-pointer speed values. Only every second tick (even numbers) on the 1–20 scale actually changes anything.

Method 2: 
**Windows Settings -> Devices -> Mouse -> Additional mouse options -> Pointer Options tab -> Select a pointer speed**

Method 3: 
**Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Mouse -> Pointer Options tab -> Select a pointer speed**

ethod 4:
**Win + R -> main.cpl -> Pointer Options tab**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows 11</summary>

Method 1:  
**Windows Settings -> Bluetooth & Devices -> Mouse -> Mouse pointer speed**  
Same as Windows 10's 1–20 scale, every second tick matters.

Method 2: 
**Windows Settings -> Bluetooth & Devices -> Mouse -> Additional mouse settings -> Pointer Options tab**

Method 3: 
**Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Mouse -> Pointer Options tab**

Method 4: 
**Win + R -> main.cpl -> Pointer Options tab**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Older than Windows 10</summary>

Method 1:  
**Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Mouse -> Pointer Options tab**

Method 2: 
**Win + R -> main.cpl -> Pointer Options tab**

If you're using the `1/20` notched slider. Keep it at default which is `10/20`

If you're using the `1/11` notched slider. Keep it at default which is `6/11`


### Recommendations

#### Operating System Sensitivity

It is recommended to keep your operating system level sensitivity at default and instead adjust your mouse DPI using your mouse driver software.

#### Enhance Pointer Precision / Mouse Acceleration

**(Highly Recommended)**

Disable `Enhance pointer precision` for a fixed `1:1` relationship between hand movement and cursor movement.

**(Not Recommended. Only Preference)**
Enabling `Enhance pointer precision` introduces mouse acceleration, which means the faster you move your mouse, the farther the cursor goes, the slower you move your mouse, the lesser the cursor moves on screen. 

Try doing this right now to demonstrate what I mean by mouse acceleration:

1. Put your left hand palm to the left side of your mouse, try centering your cursor on the screen so you can better see the difference later.

2. Move your mouse horizontally like 2 inch to the right, then flick it horizontally to the left again until it reaches your palm. You'll see the difference as well if you don't flick it and instead move the mouse slowly back to your palm.

3. You'll see it slip farther from where you started, if it does then you have mouse acceleration, if not, then you're good.

This makes your aim inconsistent, especially in games like osu!standard, where muscle memory relies on a fixed `1:1` relationship between hand movement and cursor movement.
However, you are free to deviate from this due to preference.

#### Mouse Pad

Depends on the material of your preference. It does not matter which one you choose. 

**(Recommended)**

You should typically avoid mouse pads with glossy or reflective surfaces.

**List of Surface Materials**

Wood - If the surface is glossy then your mouse sensor will have a hard time.

Glass - Slippery, easy to clean. If the surface is glossy or reflective then your mouse sensor will have a hard time.

Cloth - Typically the most common. Mouse sensor likes this.

Aluminum - Slippery depending on the surface, easy to clean. If the surface is glossy then your mouse sensor will have a hard time.

Leather - Rough but mouse sensor likes this.

Fabric - Mouse sensor likes this.

#### Mouse Vertical Lift Height

A higher lift height means the mouse will continue to register movement even when lifted slightly off the surface.

A lower lift height means tracking stops sooner once the mouse is off the pad, useful if you frequently reposition your mouse mid-play.

Completely does not matter unless you hover with mouse which some absurdly do (like me from the past to reduce friction on the mouse pad, lol).

#### Mouse DPI

For the most part, it does not matter. Choose whatever comfortable DPI you want, high or low. Lower DPI means you're more than likely to move your hand, wrist or arm a lot, good for working out I guess.

### osu!

#### Sensitivity

Adjusting this setting from its default value `1.0x` will automatically enable `Raw Input`.

#### Raw Input
The setting in osu! called `Raw Input` matters for mouse.

**(Recommended)**

When **enabled**, osu! reads the device's movement data directly, ignoring any operating system level adjustments, provide the most accurate mouse movement and you'll be able to adjust your osu! sensitivity.

**(Preference)**

When **disabled**, osu! receives input that has already been modified by the operating system (e.g., Windows mouse acceleration or pointer speed settings).

Disabling it is preference. If the player kept kept the default `1:1` operating sensitivity and had mouse acceleration disabled, it should feel a little similar to when `Raw Input` is enabled.

You can keep `Raw Input` disabled if you want your cursor aim to feel the same like in the Desktop with operating system level adjustments. osu! sensitivity will automatically be at `1.0x`.

## Aiming with Tablet

### Operating System

It doesn't matter. Choose whatever mouse settings you want since you'll be aiming with tablet anyways. Tablet completely ignores mouse acceleration and uses absolute positioning by default.

### Recommendations

#### Tablet Driver and Software

Use whichever tablet driver you prefer, whether it's the official driver from the manufacturer or a third-party alternative that gives you more control.

#### Tablet Area

For the most part, it does not matter. Choose whatever area you want, large or small. Larger area means you're more than likely to move your hand, wrist or arm a lot, good for working out I guess.

#### Force Aspect Ratio / Force Proportions

**(Highly Recommended)**

Make sure to enable a tablet setting along the lines of `Force aspect ratio` or `Force proportions`. `Force aspect ratio` option in your tablet driver settings makes sure that the tablet's active area matches the aspect ratio of your monitor (typically 16:9 or 16:10), even if you're using a custom area. Good for building muscle memory on a specific aspect ratio too.

**(Not Recommended and Preference)**

Disabling `Force aspect ratio` option can introduce input distortion.

Some players do this intentionally to reduce movement range in a specific direction (often horizontal), optimizing for jumps or streams, especially with small tablet areas.

#### Tablet Mode

**(Highly Recommended)**

`Absolute Tablet Mode`

Your pen position maps directly to a point on your screen. (e.g., Top-left of your tablet = top-left of your screen).
Best since it gives instant, predictable movement and no cursor drift, the main selling point of tablets for osu!

**(Not Recommended and Only Preference)**

`Relative Tablet Mode`

Cursor moves or will be moved like a mouse, you drag it around from your current position.

> [!WARNING]
> ⚠️ Some cracked players use this (e.g., `worst HR player`), but it removes the key benefit of tablets: precision and fixed mapping.

#### Filters, Smoothing, Anti-chatter

Unless you have any good reason why you use them, don't bother adding any or enabling them.

Let me double down on this, don't apply them!

### osu!

#### Sensitivity

**(Recommended)**

Set or keep the setting to its default at `1.0x`.

Adjusting this setting from its default value `1.0x` will automatically enable `Raw Input`.

#### Raw Input
The setting in osu! called `Raw Input` does not matter for tablet, but it is recommended to disable `Raw Input` if you use tablet.

`Raw Input` in osu! is only relevant for mouse devices. Tablets already send absolute position data directly to the game, bypassing operating system level cursor behavior by design.

**(Recommended)**

When **disabled**, osu! sensitivity will be at `1.0x`.

**(Preference)**

When **enabled**, you'll be able to adjust your osu! sensitivity. However, it is recommended not to adjust your tablet sensitivity this way, instead adjust it using your tablet driver software by changing your tablet area.
