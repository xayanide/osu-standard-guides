## Aiming with Mouse

## Operating System
It is recommended to keep your OS-level sensitivity at default.

In Windows, the setting shown in the image is `6/11` on the Windows "Pointer Speed" slider with "Enhance pointer precision" (Mouse acceleration) disabled. Commonly referred to as the default or `1:1` setting for mouse sensitivity. There should be a setting similar to these
in other operating systems.

`6/11` is the midpoint of the 11-notch scale.

At this setting, the pointer speed is not scaled (multiplied by 1.0), so one unit of physical mouse movement corresponds to one unit of pointer movement.

This is often called the "1:1 ratio" or "true DPI" setting because it reflects the actual DPI (dots per inch) of your mouse.

Another slider can be found in Windows 10 and above is `1/20`.

<summary>Windows 10</summary>

Method 1:
**Windows Settings -> Devices -> Mouse -> Cursor Speed**  
This just maps to the same 11-pointer speed values. Only every second tick (even numbers) on the 1–20 scale actually changes anything.

Method 2: 
**Windows Settings -> Devices -> Mouse -> Additional mouse options -> Pointer Options tab -> Select a pointer speed**

Method 3: 
**Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Mouse -> Pointer Options tab -> Select a pointer speed**

ethod 4:
**Win + R -> main.cpl -> Pointer Options tab**

<details>
<summary>Windows 11</summary>

Method 1:  
**Windows Settings -> Bluetooth & Devices -> Mouse -> Mouse pointer speed**  
Same as Windows 10's 1–20 scale, every second tick matters.

Method 2: 
**Windows Settings -> Bluetooth & Devices -> Mouse -> Additional mouse settings -> Pointer Options tab**

Method 3: 
**Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Mouse -> Pointer Options tab**

Method 4: 
**Win + R -> main.cpl -> Pointer Options tab**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Older than Windows 10</summary>

Method 1:  
**Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Mouse -> Pointer Options tab**

Method 2: 
**Win + R -> main.cpl -> Pointer Options tab**

This guide cannot cover all the methods for the same setting on every Linux distro, please look up tutorials according to your Linux distro on how to adjust operating system level mouse speed as well as disabling mouse acceleration (equivalent of Enhance pointer precision in Windows).

If you're using the 1/20 notched slider. Keep it at default which is 10/20

If you're using the 1/11 notched slider. Keep it at default which is 6/11

### Recommended settings

Disable `Enhance pointer precision` because, in simple terms, it means mouse acceleration, the faster you move your mouse, the farther the cursor goes, the slower you move your mouse, the lesser the cursor moves on screen. 

Try doing this right now to demonstrate what I mean by mouse acceleration:

1. Put your left hand palm to the left side of your mouse, try centering your cursor on the screen so you can see the difference better.

2. Move your mouse horizontally like 2 inch to the right, then flick it horizontally to the left again until it reaches your palm. You'll see the difference as well if you don't flick it and instead move the mouse slowly back to your palm.

3. You'll see it slip farther from where you started, if it does then you have mouse acceleration, if not, then you're good.

This makes your aim inconsistent, especially in games like osu!, where muscle memory relies on a fixed `1:1` relationship between hand movement and cursor movement.
However, you are free to deviate from this due to preference.

### Raw Input
The setting in osu! called `Raw Input` matters for mouse.

When **enabled**, osu! reads the device's movement data directly, ignoring any OS-level adjustments. **(Recommended)**

When **disabled**, osu! receives input that has already been modified by the operating system (e.g., Windows mouse acceleration or pointer speed settings). **(Preference)**

Disabling it is preference. If the player kept `6/11` default Windows or OS level sensitivity and didn't have `Enhance pointer precison` enabled, it should feel a little similar to when `Raw Input` is enabled.

You can keep Raw Input off when you want your cursor aim to feel the same as if you are using the Desktop. Assuming osu! sensitivity is at `1.0x` at default.
