# Muscle Memory Guide for Click-X/KB Alternate Playstyle
By xayanide

*For osu!standard game mode.*

This includes tips for full alternate.

TODO: Add more stuff to this later, -xaya

## Intro

I am mianly a Mouse/KB player and M1/KBX playstyle is one of my perceived playstyles in osu!standard, I don't have any notable scores with the unique playstyle yet but I alternate tap with it on Easy, Normal, Hard difficulty beatmaps with NoMod.

This guide is made to share my insights and what I've experienced while learning `haga1115`'s playstyle.

haga1115 has a background in osu!taiko so his taiko tapping skills are fully applied with click/x when playing osu!standard. I don't have that so it'll take some getting used to as well as for others that don't have that background.

## Core Concept for Full Alternate
In the **Click-X / Keyboard Alternate** playstyle (e.g., using **M1 + Z** or **M1 + X**), building reliable muscle memory involves two distinct tapping techniques. Understanding and practicing both will help with rhythm consistency and finger independence.

> [!NOTE]
> The tapping technique and the insights behind it will also apply to Tap/X on tablet, Mouse/KB or Tablet/KB in general as well.

## Two Tapping Techniques for Muscle Memory

### 1. Tap-and-Hold (Slider-Like Tapping)
Treat each hit circle like the head of a slider — **hold briefly** instead of releasing immediately.  
This builds **deliberate and stronger muscle memory**.

**Example pattern:**
Where C# is a circle.

- `C1 → tap and hold Z`
- `C2 → release Z, then click and hold M1`
- `C3 -> and cycles back again.`

> This technique emphasizes *rhythm anchoring* through intentional holds.

### 2. Tap-and-Release (Normal Tapping)
You may switch to this kind of tapping after feeling comfortable with the playstyle and with first tapping technique mentioned above.
Tap and **immediately release** each input except for sliders of course.
This builds **speed and timing precision** under standard alternating flow.

**Example pattern:**
Where C# is a circle.

- `C1 → tap Z, release Z`
- `C2 → tap M1, release M1`
- `C3 -> and cycles back again.`

> This method mimics typical alternating, good for learning streams and bursts.

--- 

Finally, here's a demonstration video on how your `Key Overlay` should look like:

> **Left side clip**: Lifting the finger right away after pressing the key (Tap-and-Release).
> **Right side clip**: Tap-and-hold.
> Clips are not precisely synced, just a short video about what I was talking about.
> Same beatmap, same 100% accuracy. Tapped in a different manner.

## Rule for Consistent Full Alternation

You have to be disciplined in your tapping.
Always **match the finger used** based on your starting input. This is critical for muscle memory in **triplets and sliders**:

- If you start a triplet with **KB**, the third note should also be **KB**.
- If you start with **M1**, finish the triplet with **M1**.

- If a spinner follows a note, hold the key you used for that note to start the spinner. Don’t tap again, or you'll break your alternating pattern and it adds another input.

## Muscle Memory Patterns

Where `C` is a circle.
Where `S` is a slider.

### Simple Triplets
```
KB - M1 - KB
C  - C  - C

M1 - KB - M1
C  - C  - C
```

### Triplet → Slider
```
KB - M1 - KB - M1 (hold)
C  - C  - C  - S

M1 - KB - M1 - KB (hold)
C  - C  - C  - S
```

### Triplet with Slider as Third Note
```
KB - M1 - KB (hold)
C  - C  - S

M1 - KB - M1 (hold)
C  - C  - S
```

### ... And many more.

As much as possible, find beatmaps that have these kinds of patterns, they're prominent in Hard and Insane difficulty maps. Isolating and doing drills with these patterns will eventually give you the muscle memory for streams too.

Or you could also play any Hard and Insane difficulty beatmaps that have haga1115 in the top 50 / top 1 on it, without Double Time of course lol, you'll soon get there.

With that in mind, the sequence will become noticeable as a subconscious. It'll just flow in the beatmap as you play. Different sequences and patterns may appear and the same idea can be applied with your foundation of muscle memory that you have learned above.

## Tips
- For practicing, stick with beatmaps that have `<=150` BPM. Though, I recommend `<=130` for starters, or `270` BPM which is a double of `135` on some beatmaps, which is still technically 135 on lower diffs based on how their notes are snapped.
- Choose **one tapping style per map or section** because switching mid-pattern can confuse your fingers and hurt your already built muscle memory.
- Prioritize **consistency over speed** when training muscle memory.
- Make sure you can hear hitsounds and observe your tapping if you've done it right or not, if not then try to tap it properly when you encounter a similar pattern again mid-play.
- Assuming you already have the fundamentals, **start with 3 stars Hard difficulty beatmaps** that are not too fast. Look for maps with **frequent triplets and sliders** to isolate and drill the technique for full alternate.
- As you improve, **gradually increase BPM and difficulty**. Progress into Insane maps **only when you feel comfortable** with your tapping style.
- Avoid aim-heavy or aim demanding bursty maps until your **tapping consistency is solid**. Focus on **control and form first**.
